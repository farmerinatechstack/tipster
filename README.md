Tipster - a lightweight tip calculator and pre-project for CodePath

Time spent: approximately 10 hours in total. I have never owned a Mac, so I had to complete the project in a local library. This entailed familiarizing myself with and preparing relevant software. I plan on buying myself a MacBook in the coming week.

Completed user stories:

- Required: created basic tip calculator
- Required: created settings page and persisted changes to home page
- Optional: refined UI & changed color scheme
- Optional: added clickable gear icon for settings
- Optional: imported new fonts
- Optional: added per person pricing for large parties

Notes: A large amount of time was spent on overcoming the usage hiccups inherent to using a Mac and XCode for the first time. This was further complicated by the fact that I was not using my own computer for development. However, I do like the experience I had using a Mac. It confirmed my previous plan to buy a MacBook over Spring Break.
